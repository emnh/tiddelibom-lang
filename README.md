The Infinitely Dumb Extensible Programming Language

The idea for this new programming language is to have a tiny extensible core,
which can be extended linearly in complexity by "examples". The compiler
should be so dumb that anyone can easily extend it.

There will be no nested structures in the language itself,
but there will be an autogenerated visual representation for examining the implicitly nested structure.
We will either 
 - make it a subset of an existing programming language, say Javascript.
 - make the syntax trivially simple.
